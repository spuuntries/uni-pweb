## **Description**

For this project, I implemented a homepage for a (fictional) CTF team named "CatTheCat", along with an Open Recruitment registration form and a Member List.

### **Home Page**

The idea for this page layout was inspired by some web pages I've been seeing recently. Namely, [https://libdb.so/](https://libdb.so/) and [https://zvava.org/](https://zvava.org/).

So I decided to try to follow in their footsteps in getting that nice window-based pagination.

The windows are all interactive and resize-able. I implemented this using `<iframe>`s and a good amount of Javascript wizardry to update the absolute positioning via HTML attributes.
